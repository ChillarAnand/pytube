What is PyTube?
---------------

PyTube aims to be an index of Python related media.

Why is PyTube?
--------------

PyTube exists to maintain and continue the work done by pyvideo.org.

The work done for pyvideo.org was invaluable to the Python community.
Many people do not have the resources (whether that be time, money,
nearby user groups, etc.) to attend Python informational and educational
events. Pyvideo.org, and now PyTube.org, are freely available indexes of
freely available resources that seek to provide everyone with the
opportunity to learn about Python.

Where is PyTube?
----------------
