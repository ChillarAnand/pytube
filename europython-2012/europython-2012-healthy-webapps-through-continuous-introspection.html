<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Every application has its hotspots – small portions of code that consume
considerably more resources than all of the other code combined. Django apps
are no different. Some pages, invoked with the just the right, or wrong input,
can bring a server to its knees, hogging the CPU and taking many seconds, or
in extreme cases even minutes to render. By keeping workers tied up, the whole
system can then become slow to respond, or collapse altogether. Many
webservers have a crude built-in failsafe to prevent this. They automatically
kill workers that fail to complete their requests in time. As a result, you
may not fully appreciate, or indeed realize at all that you are routinely
serving 500 pages, denying users access to your service, or leaving
uncommitted database transactions – possibly even slowly corrupting data.
Workers killed by force leave virtually no forensic traces and so even when
issues are suspected, it’s hard to pin them down. The cause behind these
hotspots can be poorly generated SQL queries from the ORM, an algorithm with
non-linear complexity, excessive disk or network IO, or lock contention in the
database – to name just a few. Oftentimes these problems escape a developer’s
attention, as dev and test environments simply don’t have the dataset, level
of concurrency or sheer size of the real thing. In this talk we’ll address the
challenges of tuning your Django app with continuous automatic runtime
inspection tools, including homegrown Dogslow. We’ll uncover the pages that
consume disproportionate amounts of time and cycles to complete and the pages
that get killed altogether. We’ll discuss several ways to help you identify
and eliminate the hotspots, both passively through monitoring exclusively, as
well as actively by selectively interrupting workers before they get killed
and examine how to effectively interpret the automatically collected forensic
evidence.</p>
