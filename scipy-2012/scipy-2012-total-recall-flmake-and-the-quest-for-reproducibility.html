<h2>Description</h2>
<p>[FLASH](<a class="reference external" href="http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/">http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/</a>) is a high-performance computing (HPC)
multi-physics code which is used to perform astrophysical and high-energy
density physics simulations. It runs on the full range of systems from laptops
to workstations to 100,000 processor super computers - such as the Blue Gene/P
at Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
<p>Historically, FLASH was born from a collection of unconnected legacy codes
written primarily in Fortran and merged into a single project. Over the past
13 years major sections have been rewritten in other languages. For instance,
I/O is now implemented in C. However building, testing, and documentation are
all performed in Python.</p>
<p>FLASH has a unique architecture which compiles <em>simulation specific</em>
executables for each new type of run. This is aided by an object-oriented-
esque inheritance model that is implemented by inspecting the file system's
directory hierarchy. This allows FLASH to compile to faster machine code than
a compile-once strategy. However it also places a greater importance on the
Python build system.</p>
<p>To run a FLASH simulation, the user must go through three basic steps: setup,
build, and execution. Canonically, each of these tasks are independently
handled by the user. However, with the recent advent of [flmake](<a class="reference external" href="http://flash">http://flash</a>.
uchicago.edu/site/flashcode/user_support/tools4b/usersguide/flmake/index.htm)
- a Python workflow management utility for FLASH - such tasks may now be
performed in a repeatable way.</p>
<p>Previous workflow management tools have been written for FLASH. (For example,
the &quot;Milad system&quot; was implemented entirely in Makefiles.) However, none of
the priorattempts have placed reproducibility as their primary concern. This
is in part becausefully capturing the setup metadata requires alterations to
the build system.</p>
<p>The development of flmake started by rewriting the existing build systemto
allow FLASH to be run outside of the main line subversion repository. It
separates outproject and simulation directories independent of the FLASH
source directory. Thesedirectories are typically under their own version
control.</p>
<p>Moreover for each of the important tasks (setup, build, run, etc), a sidecar
metadata _description_ file is either written or appended to. This is a simple
dictionary-of-dictionaries JSON file which stores the environment of the
system and the state of the code when each flmake command is run. This
metadata includes the version information of both the FLASH main line and
project repositories. However, it also may include _all_ local modifications
since the last commit. A patch is automatically generated using the Python
standard library <cite>difflib</cite> module and stored directly in the description.</p>
<p>Along with universally unique identifiers, logging, and Python run control
files, the flmake utility may use the description files to fully reproduce a
simulation by re-executing each command in its original environment and state.
While <cite>flmake reproduce</cite> makes a useful debugging tool, it fundamentally
increases the scientific merit of FLASH simulations.</p>
<p>The methods described above may be used whenever source code itself is
distributed. While this is true for FLASH (uncommon amongst compiledcodes),
most Python packages also distribute their source. Therefore the same
reproducibility strategy is applicable and highly recommended for Python
simulation codes. Thus flmake shows that reproducibility - which is notably
absent from most computational science projects - is easily attainable using
only version control and standard library modules.</p>
