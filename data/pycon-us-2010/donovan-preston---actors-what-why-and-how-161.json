    "description": "Actors: What, Why and How\n\n  \nPresented by Donovan Preston\n\n  \nSince the dawn of concurrency research, there have been two camps: shared\neverything, and shared nothing. Most modern applications use threads for\nconcurrency, a shared everything architecture.\n\n  \nActors, however, use a shared nothing architecture where lightweight processes\ncommunicate with each other using message passing. Actors can change their\nstate, create a new Actor, send a message to any Actor it has the Address of,\nand wait for a specific kind of message to arrive in it's mailbox.\n\n  \nWe will discuss the benefits of using the Actor architecture and strategies\nfor implementing an Actor system in Python.\n\n  \n[http://bitbucket.org/fzzzy/python-actors/](http://bitbucket.org/fzzzy/python-\nactors/)\n\n",
