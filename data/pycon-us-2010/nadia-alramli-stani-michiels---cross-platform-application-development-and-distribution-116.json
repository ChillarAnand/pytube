    "description": "Cross platform application development and distribution\n\n  \nPresented by Stani Michiels and Nadia Alramli\n\n  \nYou think Python gives you native cross platform applications for free? Think\ntwice. Are you interested in distributing your application to other platforms\nbut not sure how?\n\n  \nWe will give tips and examples on how to enhance the native feel of your\napplication: notifications, registration of file types and more. The talk will\nalso help you to avoid common pitfalls and provides solutions for designing\ncross platform user interfaces. (Although we use wxPython as an example, the\nprinciples are valid for other toolkits as well.) We'll show you where to\nstart if you want to distribute your application to different platforms,\nbriefly discussing tools like py2exe, py2app and Debian/Ubuntu packaging\necosystem. This talk is based on our experience from developing Phatch (Photo\nBatch Processor) and SPE (Python Editor).\n\n",
