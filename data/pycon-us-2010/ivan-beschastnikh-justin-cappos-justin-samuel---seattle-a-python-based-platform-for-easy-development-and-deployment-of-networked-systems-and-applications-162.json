    "description": "A Python-based Platform for Easy Development and Deployment of Networked\nSystems and Applications\n\n  \nPresented by Ivan Beschastnikh, Justin Samuel, and Justin Cappos\n\n  \nSeattle is an open-source platform for developing and deploying networked\napplications. Core feature of Seattle is that it allows safe execution of\nuntrusted code on end-user systems. In our talk we look at how we used Python\nto build a safe, restricted code execution environment for Seattle that not\nonly provides execution safety but also enforces strict resource consumption\nlimits. In addition, Seattle includes a high-level API to hide inconsistent\nOS-specific behaviors from developers. What results is a platform that\nwelcomes the participation of end-user machines for general-purpose\ndistributed programming and creates new possibilities for developers.\n\n  \n[http://seattle.cs.washington.edu/](http://seattle.cs.washington.edu/)\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Beginning of talk missing, due to technical problems.]\n\n",
