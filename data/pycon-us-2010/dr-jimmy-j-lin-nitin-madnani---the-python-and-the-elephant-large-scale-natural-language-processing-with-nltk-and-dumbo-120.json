Recently, the Python\ncommunity has seen the release of Dumbo ([http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumb\no](http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumbo)), an open-source, python-based\ncloud-computing API (based on Hadoop) via the hands of Klaas Bosteels.\n\n  \nIn this talk, we show how the amalgamation of Python, NLTK and Dumbo can allow\nfor very large-scale natural language processing efficiently and elegantly.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon US 2010", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/335_the-python-and-the-elephant-large-scale-natural-language-processing-with-nltk-and-dumbo-120.m4v", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2010-02-19", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/335_the-python-and-the-elephant-large-scale-natural-language-processing-with-nltk-and-dumbo-120.ogv", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.214", "id": 335, "related_urls": [], "slug": "pycon-2010--the-python-and-the-elephant--large-sc", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Dr. Jimmy J Lin", "Nitin Madnani"]}
