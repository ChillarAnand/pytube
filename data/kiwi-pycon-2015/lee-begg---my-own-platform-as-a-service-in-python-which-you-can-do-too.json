    "description": "Over the last couple of years I have evolved my own Platform as a Service (PaaS) for hosting Django apps, and you can run it too.\r\n\r\nI use Nginx, Circus, Chaussette, and Django, with some support from Django-environ and deployment automation using Fabric. All of that except Nginx are written in Python. Systemd is a new init process coming.\r\n\r\n* Circus is a process and socket manager, and gives a nice way to scale processes. \r\n* Chaussette WSGI server works well with Circus, as Circus can pass the socket to it.\r\n* Django-environ it's a library that parses environment variables or files with key-value pairs. Environment variables are used on some PaaS, but the file support I find very useful.\r\n* Fabric is a framework for writing system commands to be run on remote hosts, and is great for automating system administration.\r\n* Systemd is a new \"init\" process for Linux and offers some interesting possibilities for hosting Python webapps.",
