It bridges the worlds of Python and C, letting you write code that runs close to C speed in a syntax that is very close to Python.  This talk will show how you can speed up a typical Python program with Cython datatypes.  We\u2019ll call C functions directly, passing NumPy arrays with ease.  We\u2019ll see how we can release the global interpreter lock, letting us run multiple threads in parallel near C speeds.  We\u2019ll look at Cython\u2019s parallel module for data parallelism and compare it to some alternatives and discuss the pros and cons.", "state": 1, "category": "Kiwi PyCon 2015", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2015-09-05", "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "source_url": "http://youtu.be/L-FyCT02gqc", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2015-09-16T04:31:50.335", "id": 3874, "related_urls": [], "slug": "cython-get-the-benefits-of-c-without-leaving-pyt", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Chris LeBlanc"]}
