We will look at the technological and social barriers to wider adoption then gaze into the crystal ball to see where the future might take us. \r\n\r\nTo conclude we will explore one technique (partially homomorphic encryption) with a motivating medical example. A high level overview of the open source library `python-paillier` will be given along with a few code samples showing how easy (some) privacy preserving analytics can be to implement.", "state": 1, "category": "Kiwi PyCon 2015", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2015-09-06", "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "source_url": "http://youtu.be/zgCCtof4kkY", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2015-09-16T04:33:47.457", "id": 3866, "related_urls": [], "slug": "blind-analytics-getting-insight-from-data-witho", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Brian Thorne"]}
