    "description": "As every messaging service, it's main goals are:- performance, availability, durability, fault-tolerance and scalability. Besides providing support for message and notification services through OpenStack, Zaqar aims to ease the design of distributed systems and allow for asynchronous work distribution without creating yet another message broker.\r\n\r\n This talk aims to give the audience as much information as possible about Zaqar's architecture, design, patterns, performance, issues it faced and how why it was built from scratch.",
