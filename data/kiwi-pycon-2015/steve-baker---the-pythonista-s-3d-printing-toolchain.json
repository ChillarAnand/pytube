[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) is software for creating solid 3D CAD models. OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller, instead it is something like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object and renders the 3D model from this script file.\r\n\r\n[Cura](https://github.com/daid/Cura) is the Python-based user interface to the CuraEngine slicing library, which processes 3D models into 3D printing instructions for various printers.\r\n\r\n[BotQueue](https://www.botqueue.com/) is a 3D printing job-control service, allowing remote submission and monitoring of printing jobs to any number of printers.\r\n\r\nThis talk will take a tour through SolidPython, Cura, and BotQueue showing how Python can help with the design, preparation, and printing of your doodad, widget, or dingus.", "state": 1, "category": "Kiwi PyCon 2015", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2015-09-06", "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "source_url": "http://youtu.be/hZygJwOcQng", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2015-09-16T04:32:43.068", "id": 3857, "related_urls": [], "slug": "the-pythonistas-3d-printing-toolchain", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Steve Baker"]}
