    "description": "Testing Demo\n\nPresented by Michael Dunstan\n\nAbstract\n\nLive demo of writing code and tests.\n\nOutline\n\nThis live demo is intended for people that have not seen test driven\ndevelopment in action before. See what a failing test should look like. And\nthen I'll attempt to write some code to make that test pass so that you can\nsee what a successful test run looks like - I may need some help from the\naudience at that point. Along the way you'll see various features of the test\nframework 'nose' in action and even some doctests. This will be a second\nattempt of the stunt first performed: [http://nzpug.org/MeetingsAuckland/Augus\nt2009.](http://nzpug.org/MeetingsAuckland/August2009)\n\nSlides: [http://www.slideshare.net/michaeldunstan/testing-\nworkshop-2455697](http://www.slideshare.net/michaeldunstan/testing-\nworkshop-2455697)\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n\n",
