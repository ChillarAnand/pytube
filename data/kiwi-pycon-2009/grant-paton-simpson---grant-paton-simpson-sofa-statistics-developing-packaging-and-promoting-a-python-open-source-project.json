Will cover wxPython (GUI toolkit)\nplus graphics generally; quirks of different databases; making python\ninstaller packages; using Sourceforge, Freshmeat, and Launchpad (and Bazaar);\nand promoting the project.\n\nOutline\n\nSOFA Statistics\n([http://www.sofastatistics.com/](http://www.sofastatistics.com/)) is an open\nsource desktop Python application with an emphasis on ease of use, learn as\nyou go, and beautiful output. The talk will cover technical aspects of the\nproject as well as project management issues. Specific areas covered will\ninclude:\n\n  * Using the cross-platform GUI toolkit wxPython (including wxWebKit and the grid widgets) plus initial exploration of Matplotlib and Raphael (Javascript and SVG) \n  * Experience using different database engines including SQLite, MySQL, MS Access, and MS SQL Server \n  * Issues with standard statistics modules e.g. in SciPy \n  * Making python installer packages \u2013 currently only deb packages and Windows installers (using NSIS). Plus managing releases. \n  * Using Sourceforge, Freshmeat, and Launchpad (including Bazaar) \n  * Promoting the project through blogging, answering posts e.g. Ubuntu, wikipedia, special aggregator lists and reviews, presentations, articles, etc. \n\nQuestions are very welcome as this is a very broad topic.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.
