One of the biggest\nchanges to the Zope architecture was the rewrite of the framework and an\nintroduction of a component architecture. Zope 3 was born. The talk covers how\ndevelopers can bootstrap a Zope 3 project using buildout, what the differences\nbetween Zope (2) and Zope 3 is, how views and models are created and\nregistered, how third party applications are used and how common pitfalls can\nbe avoided.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.
