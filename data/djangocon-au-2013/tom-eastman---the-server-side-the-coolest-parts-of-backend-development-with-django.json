Including clever uses of selenium and webdriver to run unit tests, integration tests and even Javascript tests.\r\n - Considerations of Django use and web security. Including the sorts of things Django does a great job of protecting you from, and the things where your own due dilligence will always be required.", "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.317", "id": 2246, "related_urls": [], "slug": "the-server-side-the-coolest-parts-of-backend-dev", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Tom Eastman"]}
