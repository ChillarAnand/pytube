    "description": "To provide access to enterprise directory data and services to developers at\nTexas A&M; University, we have implemented a set of RESTful web services,\nusing Django as our framework. Because these services include access to\nprotected data, all web service clients must authenticate and be authorized to\naccess a particular service. In order to implement the logic for making\nauthentication and authorization decisions in one place, and cleanly apply it\nto any view, we wrote a custom decorator. This talk will cover the basic\nconcepts behind decorators, how to write a decorator, and walk through our\nimplementation of a decorator for authN/authZ.\n\n",
