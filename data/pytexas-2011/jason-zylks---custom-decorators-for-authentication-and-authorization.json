Because these services include access to\nprotected data, all web service clients must authenticate and be authorized to\naccess a particular service. In order to implement the logic for making\nauthentication and authorization decisions in one place, and cleanly apply it\nto any view, we wrote a custom decorator. This talk will cover the basic\nconcepts behind decorators, how to write a decorator, and walk through our\nimplementation of a decorator for authN/authZ.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "PyTexas 2011", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pytexas-2011/555_custom-decorators-for-authentication-and-authorization.m4v", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": null, "copyright_text": "", "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "An introduction to writing decorators, with an example of how they can be used\nto handle common authentication and authorization actions for a set of web\nservices.\n\n", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 147004946, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.411", "id": 555, "related_urls": [], "slug": "custom-decorators-for-authentication-and-authoriz", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Jason Zylks"]}
