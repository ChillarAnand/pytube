    "description": "Following are the topics we'll cover:\n\n  * Language/API design and how warts can creep into even well designed products over time.\n  * \"Worse is better\" approach may be good enough (\"satisficing\").\n  * An eclectic mix of language constructs that usually trip newcomers--and sometimes even experienced programmers--which we'll survey:\n    1. __new__\n    2. __del__\n    3. __call__\n    4. __slots__\n    5. classmethod vs. staticmethod\n    6. decorators (guidelines for writing your own)\n    7. class decorators vs. metaclasses\n    8. delegation via getattr\n    9. Interfaces and getattr\n  * We'll see how delegation and interfaces tie into the thinking behind GoF Design Patterns.\n\n",

The aim is to reduce the number of language APIs and constructs\nmost programmers have to carry in their head to a smaller and more coherent\nset. Along the way some best practices will also be discussed that are at a\nhigher level than things that can be flagged by automated syntax checking\ntools such as pylint, pyflakes, etc.\n\n",
