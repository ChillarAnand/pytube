The\ntalk will include an introduction to MongoDB (NoSQL, data structures,\nquerying, indexing, differences from relational databases, etc); some\nimportant performance and reliability features like its support for replica\nsets, sharding, and map/reduce; and some very cool features like GridFS and\ngeospatial indexing. All of this, with the exception of database\nconfiguration, will be demoed with MongoDB's python client.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "PyTexas 2011", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pytexas-2011/559_getting-started-with-pymongo.m4v", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": null, "copyright_text": "", "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "A look at how to get started with MongoDB using Python.
