    "description": "Development environments are a necessary part of every developer's workflow. They can also be a great source of friction. What may begin as simply running  `python my_app.py` eventually bloats as you add more apps, more databases, more testing frameworks, and more developers. We'll talk about the evolution of a typical development environment, how it lets us down, and how we try to make it better. We'll end with an introduction to Dusty, a new tool which uses Docker containers to take our development environments to the next level.",
