More important still, iterators have grown into prominence, and very often they\u2019ll be the best choice \u2013 and they come with a large set of relevant patterns and idioms.\r\n\r\nThe tectonic shift that\u2019s taking us from classic to modern Python goes even deeper \u2013 even the dominance of good old duck typing is threatened! Specifically, in many cases, we use, instead, goose typing \u2013 checking against an abstract base class \u2013 and, as type annotations slowly emerge, they reinforce this general tendency.\r\n\r\nThese, and a miscellanea of smaller patterns and idioms (concerning I/O, best uses of dicts and other specialized mappings, async operations, testing, \u2026), are fast becoming indispensable parts of the Proficient Pythonista\u2019s repertoire.", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon Italia 2015", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2015-06-09", "copyright_text": "", "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeuChRCByZc", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "As Python grows, the problem spaces we address keep shifting, and best practices for software development mature, so does the set of best-of-breed patterns and idioms change: some classics fading, new stars emerging.
