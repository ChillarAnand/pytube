I\u2019ve worked with Java developers to get models into production and there aren\u2019t always the same libraries in Java as there are in Python. Example try porting Scikitlearn code to Java.\nPossible solution: PMML (from last time) or you write spec.\nAn even better solution: I will explain how to use Science Ops from YhatHQ to build better data products. Specifically I will talk about how to use a Python, Pandas etc to build a model. Test it locally and then deploy it so thatdevelopers can get an easy to use RESTful API. \nI will remark some of my experiences from working with it, and give a use case and some architectural remarks.  I\u2019ll also give a run down of alternatives to Science Ops that I\u2019ve found.\nPre Requisites - some experience with Pandas and the scientific Python would be beneficial. This talk is aimed at Data Science enthusiasts or professionals. \n", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon Italia 2015", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2015-05-29", "copyright_text": "", "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thMh_mpp6s8", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2015-06-14T17:02:23.200", "id": 3590, "related_urls": [], "slug": "how-to-get-data-science-models-into-production-on", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Peadar Coyle"]}
