But what if you encounter such problems? What if your program never releases memory? How do you debug it?\r\n\r\nI will tell a story of one programmer discovering such problems. The talk will take listeners on a journey of issues they can encounter, tools they can use to debug the problems and possible solutions to seek out. There will also be a brief mention of general memory management principles.\r\n\r\ncPython uses a combination of its own allocator, `malloc`, and `mmap` pools to manage memory of Python programs. It usually is smart enough, but there are some darker corners that are not well known by an average Joe Programmer (read: me). \r\n\r\nThere are tools that can help debug memory problems, but those are also relatively unknown, and tend to have documentation that one might find lacking. I will describe one such tool, called `guppy`, which I have found particulary helpful.", "state": 1, "category": "EuroPython 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-07-25", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9Le_JOwgsM", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "Working with Python does not usually involve debugging memory problems: the interpreter takes care of allocating and releasing system memory and you get to enjoy working on real world issues.
