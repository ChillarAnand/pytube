In this scenario, graph databases are the ideal, they are designed and implemented to deal with connected information in a efficient way.\r\nIn this talk I'll explain why NoSQL is necessary in some contexts as an alternative to traditional relational databases. How graph databases allow developers model their domains in a natural way without translating these domain models to an relational model with some artificial data like foreign keys and why is more efficient a graph database than a relational one or even a document database in a high connected environment. Then I'll explain specific characteristics of Neo4J as well as how to use Cypher the neo4j query language through python.", "state": 1, "category": "EuroPython 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-07-23", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZVPsuWODpg", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "There are many kinds of NoSQL databases like, document databases, key-value, column databases and graph databases.\r\nIn some scenarios is more convenient to store our data as a graph, because we want to extract and study information relative to these connections.
