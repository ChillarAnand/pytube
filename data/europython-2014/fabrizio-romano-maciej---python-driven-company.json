We\u2019ve challenged the dominant position of Microsoft Excel and similar tools, and dared to replace it by pandas-powered ipython notebooks.\r\n\r\nDuring this transitional phase, we have been inspired and sometimes forced to develop multiple packages that extend pandas, numpy etc., in order to enable our colleagues, in other departments, to access all the data they need. Moreover, we are developing several high level functionalities for the notebook environment. \r\n\r\nThe notebook environment is allowing us to be extremely responsive to the changes our users are asking for, since, for part of the work, we don\u2019t have to go through the whole traditional development process.\r\n\r\nThe talk focuses on challenges and problems we\u2019ve solved and managed in order to achieve our long term goal of creating highly agile, data-driven non-tech teams, free from the constraints imposed by mainstream technologies, and all of this thanks to python.", "state": 1, "category": "EuroPython 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-07-25", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kIXlgK-uUY", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "Adopting Python across a company brings extra agility and productivity not provided by traditional mainstream tools like Excel.
