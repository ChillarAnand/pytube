Amongst other things I will touch on the difference between languages (and their respective communities), the architecture of the client itself, mapping out the API and making sure it stays up to date and integrating with existing tools.\r\n", "state": 1, "category": "EuroPython 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-07-24", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPpiOQNNm8U", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "Lessons learned when building a client for a fully distributed system and trying to minimize context-switching pains when using multiple languages.", "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-07-31T01:32:56.936", "id": 2955, "related_urls": [], "slug": "lessons-learned-from-building-elasticsearch-clien", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Honza Kr\u00e1l"]}
