Ten years from now, will a non-TDD\r\npracticing developer experience the horror of being labelled a\r\ntechnology adoption 'laggard', and be left working exclusively on\r\ndreadfully boring legacy systems?\r\n\r\nIt could be a smart move to get down to your nearest Coding Dojo and\r\npractice TDD on some Code Katas. On the other hand, the thing with\r\ndisruptive technologies is that even they can become disrupted when\r\nsomething better comes along. What about Property-Based Testing?\r\nApproval Testing? Outside-In Development?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'd like to look at the chasm-crossing potential of TDD\r\nand some related technologies.
