From a couple of guys in a coffee shop\nto almost 100 employees, millions of users, and massive open source projects\nthat are powering businesses around the world, it's been a bit of a wild ride.\nHear about some lessons learned and challenges we've faced: things we've done\nright and others that didn't work out so well. Learn a little bit about our\ngrowing technology stack and how we design and deploy features. Get some\ninsight into why we still have no managers and how everyone decides what to\nwork on. Finally, hear about how open source has shaped the company and our\nvision of 'open' in everything from hardware to politics to education and\nscience. The social web is old news, but the collaborative web is just in its\ninfancy and GitHub sees that as a very bright future.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "SciPy 2012", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "http://s3.us.archive.org/nextdayvideo/enthought/scipy_2012/Invited_Talk.mp4?Signature=EYjC97jvwpFMboccedfKe%2Fk4N%2Fo%3D&Expires=1346382857&AWSAccessKeyId=FEWGReWX3QbNk0h3", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2012-07-19", "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.100", "id": 1229, "related_urls": [], "slug": "forking-your-way-to-success-and-happiness-how-gi", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Tim Clem"]}
