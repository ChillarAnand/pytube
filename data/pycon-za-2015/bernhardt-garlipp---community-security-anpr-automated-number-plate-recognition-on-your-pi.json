    "description": "The talk will be a introductory tutorial showing how to get an ANPR (Automated Number Plate Recognition) system, which was developed for community security, up and running on your Raspberry Pi. This will provide a comfortable starting point for any security-prone person to start monitoring the vehicles entering and leaving their community.\r\n\r\nThe target audience for this tutorial will be attendees who are interested in using single board computers (Raspberry Pi2) as a security measure in their community. The technical level of the tutorial will be suitable for beginners / intermediate level. \r\n\r\nThe tutorial will consist of the following:\r\n\r\n* Quick overview of project\r\n* Installing OpenCV\r\n* Installing ANPR framework\r\n* Connecting the IP cameras\r\n* Configuring the ANPR (training)\r\n* Retrieving data",
