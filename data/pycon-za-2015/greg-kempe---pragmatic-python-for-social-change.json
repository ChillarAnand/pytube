    "description": "[Code for South Africa](http://code4sa.org) is a civic technology lab that uses Python and open data to promote informed decision making to drive social change. We use our skills for social good.\r\n\r\nWe build tools like [Living Wage](http://living-wage.co.za/) for calculating fair wages for domestic workers, [Wazimap.co.za](http://wazimap.co.za) for exploring your neighbourhood through statistics, [Medicine Prices (mpr.code4sa.org)](http://mpr.code4sa.org) for finding cheaper generics of prescription medicines, [OpenByLaws.org.za](http://openbylaws.org.za) for local legislation that's easy to read and share, and [PMG.org.za](http://pmg.org.za) for keeping an eye on Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll discuss what civic technology means, how you can get involved, and the why, what and how of our approach to building and running more than 25 websites, services and applications with a small budget and an even smaller team.",
