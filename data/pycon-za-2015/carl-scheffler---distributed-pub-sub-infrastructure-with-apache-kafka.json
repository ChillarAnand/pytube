    "description": "[Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) is great for building a large scale distributed data bus. Even a small cluster will happily accept and store thousands of messages per second, and make them available to consumers with low latency.\r\n\r\nKafka was chosen as the solution to our publish-subscribe infrastructure at [Takealot.com](http://www.takealot.com/). It supports our event-driven systems on the website, in the warehouses and in the office, as well as our analytics and machine learning projects.\r\n\r\nThis talk will\r\n\r\n * introduce the basic Kafka principles that make things work,\r\n * outline how Kafka fits in with the rest of our architecture,\r\n * cover some of the practicalities of building Python-based Kafka services,\r\n * compare the two main Python libraries for Kafka, namely [kafka-python](https://github.com/mumrah/kafka-python) and [pykafka](https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka),\r\n * demonstrate some practical applications at Takealot.com.\r\n\r\nJoin in if you are interested in scalable distributed infrastructure.",
