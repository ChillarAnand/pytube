Despite all the moving parts in IPython, there are actually very few key ideas that drive our vision, and I will discuss how we seek to turn this vision into concrete technical constructs. We focus on making the computer a tool for insight and communication, and we will see how every piece of the IPython architecture is driven by these ideas.\n\nI will also look at IPython in the context of the broader SciPy ecosystem: both how the project's user and developer community has evolved over time, and how it maintains an ongoing dialogue with the rest of this ecosystem. We have learned some important lessons along the way that I hope to share, as well as considering the challenges that lie ahead.", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.436", "id": 2136, "related_urls": [], "slug": "scipy-2013-keynote-ipython-the-method-behind-th-1", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": []}
