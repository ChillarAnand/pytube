Last year (2012) we release version 2 of our data access protocol and made the system open to general use. http://data.rcc-acis.org\n\nACIS aggregates weather observations reported at over 20,000 stations in North America over the last 100 years. These observations are collected from a number of sources and updated multiple times a day. At any point in time, the system will select the best available data and merge them into a coherent record. The daily/hourly observations are available as well as climate products summarized over various time intervals. http://www.rcc-acis.org\n\nThe ACIS Web Services use standard web requests and formats to defined the requested data product and return the results. This data can be further refined by the user in their prefered analysis environment.\n\nThis talk introduces a pandas data loader for the ACIS Web Services.", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.335", "id": 1982, "related_urls": [], "slug": "climate-observations-from-acis-in-pandas-scipy-2", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": []}
