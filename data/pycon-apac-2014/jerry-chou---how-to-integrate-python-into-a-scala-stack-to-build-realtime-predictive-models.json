    "description": "Fliptop's primary business used to be contact record linkage. We built-out some substantial infrastructure, coding primarily in Scala, and using JVM-stack libraries. In the past year, we've moved beyond our data business into building predictive analytics applications for Sales and Marketing teams, so it was necessary to build a data science/machine learning stack. While there's plenty of machine-learning tools for the JVM, we felt that the Python ecosystem had many advantages for our use-case (which we'll discuss), and we think we integrated them in a clever way.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a data scientist and software engineer. Languages of choice are Scala and Python. I have been working with AWS for production for over three years. My interest is in building data analytics applications with cloud computing technologies.",
