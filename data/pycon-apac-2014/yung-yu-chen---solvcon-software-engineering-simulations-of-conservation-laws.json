SOLVCON targets at providing a reusable code base for systems of first-order, linear or non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs). In addition to numerical methods, modern conservation-law simulations require code for parallel computing and flexible input, output, and work flow. Researchers spend a lot of time in these supportive functionalities, although they should have focused on the physical processes or numerical methods. Further, SOLVCON emphasizes the connections among documenting, coding, and testing. Many Python-based tools are used in the development, e.g., Sphinx, NumPy, Cython, nose, etc. SOLVCON is open-source and uses a BSD-style license.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\nYung-Yu is a software developer for high-performance computing applications. His interests lie on numerical simulations of conservation laws.", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon APAC 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-06-24", "copyright_text": "youtube", "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVeKNziIQPQ", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-10-26T17:44:29.545", "id": 3254, "related_urls": [], "slug": "solvcon-software-engineering-simulations-of-cons", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Yung-Yu Chen"]}
