Instead of using fast\r\nmodeling tools, you need to know more about the essential things in modeling:\r\n\r\n- What is a model ? \r\n- How models solve your problems ?\r\n- What is the connection between models and data ?\r\n- What is the important data ? important model ?\r\n\r\nI deeply believe ...
