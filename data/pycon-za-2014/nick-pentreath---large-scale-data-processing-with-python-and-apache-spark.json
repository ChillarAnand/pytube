It offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python as well as a rich set of libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics. Spark is currently one of the most exciting and fastest-growing Apache open source projects.\nThis talk will give an overview of the Apache Spark project and introduce the basics of PySpark, the Python API for Spark. It will then dive a little deeper into PySpark internals, and finally show some examples and a live demo covering PySpark, Spark's SQL engine, and machine learning with Spark's built-in libraries as well as other Python libraries.", "video_ogv_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-large-scale-data-processing/5%20B%20Large%20Scale%20Data%20Processing%20-.ogv", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2015-08-22T21:43:26.235", "id": 3833, "related_urls": [], "slug": "large-scale-data-processing-with-python-and-apach", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Nick Pentreath"]}
