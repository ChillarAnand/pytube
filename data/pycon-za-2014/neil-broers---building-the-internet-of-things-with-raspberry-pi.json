I will show you how to build basic input and output circuits and introduce you to the RPi.GPIO Python module. We\u2019ll talk about how you can build a RESTful server on your Raspberry Pi to enable remote access. And finally, more ideas for hacking everyday objects around the home!\nNo prior electronics knowledge required.", "video_ogv_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-raspberry-pi-internet-of-things/4%20A%20Building%20the%20Internet%20of%20Things%20with%20Raspberry%20Pi-.ogv", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2015-08-22T21:43:29.820", "id": 3844, "related_urls": [], "slug": "building-the-internet-of-things-with-raspberry-pi", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Neil Broers"]}
