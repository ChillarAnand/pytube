They have been a staple of the computing world for decades: they are implemented in most programming languages, form the core of several utilities, and can be found lurking in the search-and-replace functionality of any sufficiently advanced text editor.\nDespite their usefulness, regular expressions have developed a reputation for complexity and a steep learning curve. New programmers are often warned to steer clear of them -- which is a pity, because there are some problems for which they are a quick and elegant solution.\nIn this talk I aim to demystify regular expressions for the beginner programmer, and to provide a brief guided tour of Python's re module. I hope to encourage more programmers to get to know this useful tool.", "video_ogv_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-regular-expressions/9%20A%20An%20introduction%20to%20regular%20expressions%20in%20Python-.ogv", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2015-08-22T21:43:30.469", "id": 3846, "related_urls": [], "slug": "an-introduction-to-regular-expressions-in-python", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Adrianna Pi\u0144ska"]}
