(Wherever I say Debian in this abstract, it applies to Ubuntu too). The talk should explain a bit about how and why libraries are packaged in Debian, and how to help maintain (or contribute) packages you care about.\nWe'll cover a bit of history of the Python stacks in Debian and how packaged modules are provided, and who does the work. For context, we'll take a quick detour into Debian packaging in general, and the Debian project's lifecycle.\nDebian recently gained a new Python packaging tool, pybuild. This finally makes it easy to package the same library for Python 2, 3, and even PyPy. So, we'll have a look at what it does, and some example packaging.", "video_ogv_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-in-debian/11%20a%20Python%20in%20Debian%20%26%20Ubuntu-.ogv", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2015-08-22T21:43:29.502", "id": 3843, "related_urls": [], "slug": "python-in-debian-ubuntu", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Stefano Rivera"]}
