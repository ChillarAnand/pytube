    "description": "Ten years after the project known as \"Django\" was released to the public, there are still unanswered questions. Why did one of the original authors flee the country?

I'll be attempting to throw light on some of the dark secrets of Django and, perhaps, finally divine its true purpose, after almost a decade of searching.",
