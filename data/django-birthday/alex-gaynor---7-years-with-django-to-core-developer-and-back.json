Over the next few years I became a frequent contributor to Django, including becoming a core developer and later a member of the DSF board. Now I'm largely uninvolved with Django's development. This talk is the story of my time with Django. This talk is a walk through my time with Django -- from emailing Adrian to ask about attending a sprint that had already happened, to contributing patches, to the multi-db GSOC, to Eric Florenzano's keynote, becoming a core developer, joining the board, to slowly fading away and becoming an emeritus developer.", "state": 1, "category": "Django Birthday", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2015-07-11", "copyright_text": "", "source_url": "http://youtu.be/3IGbdwU1aXQ", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2015-07-16T21:30:49.781", "id": 3655, "related_urls": [], "slug": "7-years-with-django-to-core-developer-and-back", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Alex Gaynor"]}
