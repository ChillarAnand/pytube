    "description": "Astropy continues to see significant growth in available software, developers, and users. A new major release (V0.3) was made in the past year as well as many minor releases. V0.4 is scheduled for release by the time of conference and will include support for the VO SAMP protocol. We will report on the progress made in building and enhancing the core libraries in the Astropy Project, including a new model and fitting framework, enhanced units, quantities, and table functionality, a VO cone search tool, and a new convolution subpackage. We'll review the current set of tools available, highlighting in particular the new capabilities present. We will also give an overview of current activities and development plans for the core and affiliated packages, as well as adding new resources/tutorials for learning how to use astropy.",
