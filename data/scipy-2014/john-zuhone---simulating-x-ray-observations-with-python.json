    "description": "X-ray astronomy is a rapidly expanding field, thanks to the many observations of existing observatories, such as *Chandra* and *XMM-Newton*, and the anticipation of high-resolution spectral data from upcoming missions such as *Astro-H* and *Athena+*. Understanding these observations and connecting them to astrophysical mechanisms requires not only detailed modeling of the underlying physics but reliable reproduction of the observed phenomena. I present a method of creating synthetic X-ray observations from numerical simulations, which leverages several astronomical Python libraries, including [yt](http://yt-project.org \\\"yt\\\"), [AstroPy](http://www.astropy.org \\\"AstroPy\\\"), and [PyXspec](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/python/html/ \\\"PyXspec\\\"). I will describe the method of generating the observations, the Python packages used, and applications of the method, including connecting observations of galaxy clusters with MHD simulations and preparing simulations for observation proposals.",
