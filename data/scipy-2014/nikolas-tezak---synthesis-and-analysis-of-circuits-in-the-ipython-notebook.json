Our existing [QNET](http://mabuchilab.github.io/QNET/) software package allows to model these circuits in a purely symbolic fashion and interfaces with various codes for numerical simulation. \r\n\r\nWe demonstrate that the extension of our package with a visual circuit editor leads to a rich integrated simulation and analysis workflow in which an engineer or researcher can receive very fast feedback when making changes to his model.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, it is much easier to build intuition for the particular kinds of circuit models and find novel and creative solutions to an engineering task.\r\n\r\nFinally, given the broad range of applications for circuit models and representations, we outline how our visual circuit editor can be adapted to export a circuit for interfacing with other domain specific software such as Modelica.\r\n", "state": 1, "category": "SciPy 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-07-13", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kUzWdKOgqc", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "Building on the new IPython 2.0 widget model and the jsPlumb package we create a schematic capture tool that allows graphically editing a circuit as well as its components' parameters and then instantly updating a domain specific modeling backend.
