This talk's aim is to provide a conceptual answer to that question. The overall process of tokenizing, parsing, creating an AST, and then finally emitting bytecode will be covered. \r\n\r\nIf you have no clue what any of those previous words meant, don't worry! This talk will be accessible to people who are not compiler experts. We'll also cover how various parts of the compiler are exposed through Python's standard library so you can play with what you learn afterwards.", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.170", "id": 2331, "related_urls": [], "slug": "from-source-to-code-how-cpythons-compiler-works", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Brett Cannon"]}
