    "description": "Need for Speed\n\nPresented by Dr. Graeme Cross\n\n\"Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put\nin a speed hack until you have proven that's where the bottleneck is.\" (Rob\nPike)\n\nPython is a great balance of productivity, expressiveness and performance, but\nthere are times when it would nice to have a Python application run faster.\nThis is particularly true for large scale data processing, numerical work,\ncontrolling real world devices, and animation.\n\nUsing some real-world examples, this talk covers tools and techniques that\nallow you to systematically understand where the bottlenecks are in your code\nand then how to effectively optimise your code, without having to resort to\nwriting modules in C/C++.\n\n",
