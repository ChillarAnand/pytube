However, by looking at the\nsuccesses and challenges faced by other CMSes and collections of apps such as\nPinax, we have taken the philosophy a stage futher.\n\nRather than being a collection of Django apps, we have constructed GLAMkit as\na collection of optional and reusable Django 'toolkits' for implementing\ncommon features. We leave the implementation details - the things that Django\nalready does brilliantly - to the application developers themselves.\n\nIn this talk, we will present the history of GLAMkit's development, with\nparticular focus on how our approach to reusability came about, and some\nexamples of that approach.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon AU 2010", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": null, "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.776", "id": 472, "related_urls": [], "slug": "pyconau-2010--glamkit--a-harder--better--faster--", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-au-2010/472_pyconau-2010-glamkit-a-harder-better-faster-stronger-way-to-write-reusable-django-code.flv", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Dr. Greg Turner"]}
