There's an opportunity there to solve problems automatically rather than through human input. Member Eric Stein designed a Python / OpenCV based application (lidless) to monitor four video cameras in the space and offer a REST API, a web front end with historical graphs, and an IRC bot in the IRC channel to relay information about how busy the space is.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a short demo of the application accompanied by motivations and high level archtechture breakdown. Following the demo/archtechture I'll dive into the parts of the code that people are most interested in hearing about with Q&A.\r\n", "state": 1, "category": "ChiPy", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2011-11-10", "copyright_text": "", "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiUPv2Q01lw", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "A great Eye, lidless, wreathed in webcams.", "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-09-07T20:45:54.225", "id": 3147, "related_urls": [{"url": "http://cons.truct.org/archives/lidless-chipy.html", "description": "blog"}], "slug": "lidless-video-analyzer-and-irc-bot", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Eric Stein"]}
