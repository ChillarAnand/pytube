    "description": "Dealing with big data isn't a particularly new problem. There are all sorts of\nnew solutions, each with their own niche, their own hype. It's important to\nremember that python is not \"too slow\" for big data, and that with projects\nsuch as scipy, numpy, cython and rpy, python is becoming a better tool then\never for data processing. In this talk we'll be explaining some of the theory\nbehind big data problems, where python fits in and some of the more\ninteresting things you can do.\n\n",
