Rob has been part of a Python team writing a pricing\nengine based on network graphs. We will show:\n\n  * Why pricing is not easy\n  * Rule engine anti-patterns, e.g. to change one price requires a week's development time, and has to be fitted into a release cycle\n  * How to make pricing rules data driven, usable by the business\n  * How the use of graphs and sets reduces the complexity\n\nRob is joined by David Layton of Grey Squirrel Consulting, who is a fellow\ncontractor working with Rob on the pricing project. He is an American\nexpatriate and Python developer, currently living and working in London. His\nbackground is in scientific computing, CRMs and Business Intelligence.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "EuroPython 2011", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2011-07-13", "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzXvVqdL6yk", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Rob Collins - 22 June 2011 in \"Track Ravioli \"\n\n", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.864", "id": 1114, "related_urls": [], "slug": "pricing-products-using-python-graphs-and-sets-0", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Rob Collins"]}
