    "description": "Storm is an object relational mapper for SQL databases, with builtin support\nfor PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite. It was designed and implemented as part of\nthe Landscape project at Canonical in mid-2006 and was open sourced in\nmid-2007. Since then it's been used in a variety of projects, in production\nfor many years, and has received numerous enhancements and bug fixes. The\nfeatures of Storm will be explained with a series of examples and with\ndiscussion about what's happening in each one. In addition to describing the\nconcepts and features that a developer needs to understand, a variety of best\npractices will be shared, to help developers make the best use of Storm.\n\nThe examples in this talk assume that participants have a good understanding\nof SQL, transactions, relationships between tables and other common database\nconcepts.\n\n",
