    "description": "Network Analysis has gained a huge recognition since the widespread adoption\nof on-line social networking systems. It is a cross-disciplinary subject with\nimportant contributions from researchers of different areas such as physics,\nsociology, maths and computer science.\n\nHowever, Network Analysis is also a useful tool for the working programmer.\nThe basic techniques which will be introduced in this talk can be used, for\nexample, both to i) test the robustness and resilience to damage of a\ntechnological network and ii) understand the structure of a social network,\nwhich can in turn lead to insight on trends and preferences gathering\ninformation from modern on-line social networking systems.\n\nAlong with the concepts, working Python code is presented, both using existing\nnetwork analysis Python tools and numeric packages. The focus is mainly placed\non code, which will be shown and discussed together with the formal theory.\n\nBasic maths skills and basic knowledge of the Python programming language are\nthe only suggested prerequisites.\n\n",
