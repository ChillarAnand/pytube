    "description": "Ever wondered how web maps are created? Ever wondered if you could build\nsomething like Google Maps over a weekend? You probably can't, but this talk\nwill show you the basics of what you need to know, such as importing data,\nrendering maps and even building simple routes. And all of this in Python!\n\nAbstract: * Learning how OSM data looks * Parsing and importing the data *\nRendering maps with Mapnik * Bits of code required to build geocoder *\nBuilding simple router with Python and PostGIS * And anything else I forgot to\nmention in this abstract but will talk about\n\nDefinitions: OpenStreetMap - the so-called \"Wikipedia of maps\" project, with\nthousands of contributors who edit the map data of the whole world. Unlike\nsimilar projects, the map data is completely free (both as in beer and as in\nspeech) and thus anyone can make use of it. Mapnik - rendering framework,\ncreated specifically for OpenStreetMap, written in C++ and Python. PostGIS -\nan extension of PostgreSQL database, with support for many useful GIS\nfeatures.\n\n",
