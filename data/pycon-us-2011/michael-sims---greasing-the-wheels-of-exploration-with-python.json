    "description": "The Mars Exploration Rovers (MER), Spirit and Opportunity, have been roaming\nthe surface of Mars since January of 2004 leading to many discoveries about\nthe nature and history of our sister planet. Each activity requires a complex\nset of coordinated activites by a team. Early in the MER mission the author\nautomated much of the task of one of the positions, the Payload Uplink Lead,\nfor 7 of the 9 cameras on each rover. The system, called AutoPUL, is written\nin Python and that has proven to be the excellent choice for the development\nand maintenance. In the talk I'll describe the Mars Rover mission and the\noperational activities and how AutoPUL and Python fullfilled those needs.\n\n",
