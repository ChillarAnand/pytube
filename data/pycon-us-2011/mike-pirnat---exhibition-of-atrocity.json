    "description": "Exhibition of Atrocity\n\nPresented by Mike Pirnat\n\nBelieve it or not, but you can write pretty horrendously awful code even in a\nlanguage as elegant as Python. Over the years, I've committed my share of\nsins; now it's time to come clean. Step right up for a tour of twisted, evil,\nand downright wrong code, and learn some strategies to avoid writing\ncriminally bad code--if you dare!\n\nAbstract\n\nWhat does it look like when good intentions go horribly wrong? This talk will\ntake a tour through pathological code from my past (as well as some\ncontributions from friends, coworkers, and the community), featuring such\nterrors as:\n\n  * Lies, Damn Lies, and Hungarian Notation \n  * Crimes Against PEP-8 \n  * The Diaper Pattern \n  * The Beast With a Thousand Elifs \n  * The Mile-Long Club \n  * God Objects and God Methods \n  * The Malignant Menace of Mutable Keyword Arguments \n  * The Seductive Lure of Global State \n  * Slower Applications Through DTO Bondage \n  * A Twisty Maze of Single-Character Variables, All Alike \n  * Lambdas, Lambdas Everywhere \n  * The List Comprehension That Ate Cincinnati \n  * Adventures in Wheel Reinvention \n  * New and Creative Ways to Break the Build \n\n...as well as others as time permits.\n\n",
