This talk walks through how to use Genetic Algorithms and Genetic\nProgramming as tools to discover solutions to hard problems, when to use\nGA/GP, setting up the GA/GP environment, and interpreting the results. Using\n[pyevolve](http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/), we'll walk through a real-world\nimplementation creating a GP that predicts the weather.\n\nAbstract\n\nGenetic Algorithms (GA) and Genetic Programming (GP) are methods used to\nsearch for and optimize solutions in large solution spaces. GA/GP use concepts\nborrowed from natural evolution, such as mutation, cross-over, selection,\npopulation, and fitness to generate solutions to problems. If done well, these\nsolutions will become better as the GA/GP runs.\n\nGA/GP has been used in problem domains as diverse as scheduling, database\nindex optimization, circuit board layout, mirror and lens design, game\nstrategies, and robotic walking and swimming. They can also be a lot of fun,\nand have been used to evolve aesthetically pleasing artwork, melodies, and\napproximating pictures or paintings using polygons.\n\nGA/GP is fun to play with because often-times an unexpected solution will be\ncreated that will give new insight or knowledge. It might also present a novel\nsolution to a problem, one that a human may never generate. Solutions may also\nbe inscrutable, and determining why a solution works is interesting in itself.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon US 2011", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/428_genetic-programming-in-python.mp4", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2011-03-11", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 223902641, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.974", "id": 428, "related_urls": [], "slug": "pycon-2011--genetic-programming-in-python", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Eric Floehr"]}
