Users will be taught how to use so they can\nquickly adapt to their appropriate needs with a little Blender experience and\nno previous BPY experience.\n\nThere will be a brief Blender overview, an introduction to the API and how to\nuse it, as well as / along with an overview of some of the presenter's own\ntools / use cases. Some other popular 3rd party Python tools will also be\nshown as an example.\n\nIf there is time, a brief demo of the Blender Game Engine will also be given,\nthough that is a separate API.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon US 2011", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/411_using-blender-s-new-bpy-python-api.mp4", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2011-03-11", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "Blender 2.5 (a free and open source software 3d graphics suite) includes a new\nBPY python API which is usable for scripting modeling, animation, etc. Learn\nto use this API to speed up your workflow, create procedural graphics, and\ncool new tools.\n\n", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 150937361, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.057", "id": 411, "related_urls": [], "slug": "pycon-2011--using-blender--39-s-new-bpy-python-ap", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Christopher Allan Webber"]}
