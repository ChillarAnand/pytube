The seismic analyses themselves are carried out with a commercial Finite Element solver, but understanding the raw data this produces requires customised post-processing and visualisation tools. Extending the existing tools had become increasingly difficult and a decision was made to develop a new, Python-based tool-set. This comprises of a post-processing framework (\"aftershock\") which includes an an embedded Python interpreter, and a plotting package (\"afterplot\") based on numpy and matplotlib.\r\n\r\nThe new tool-set had to be significantly more flexible and easier to maintain than the existing code-base, while allowing the majority of development to be carried out by engineers with little training in software development. The resulting architecture will be described with a focus on exploring how the design drivers were met and the successes and challenges arising from the choices made.", "state": 1, "category": "EuroScipy 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-10-22", "copyright_text": "youtube", "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiqPbiWv2hY", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-11-05T22:41:03.354", "id": 3326, "related_urls": [], "slug": "a-python-based-post-processing-toolset-for-seismi", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Steve Braiser"]}
