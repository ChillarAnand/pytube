But just how many \"n\" polyominos are there?\r\n\r\nThis question has been one of our favourite interview questions. It's a deceptively simple problem with opportunities for innovative solutions and disastrous missteps. In this talk, we'll discuss the benefits of a number of approaches, demonstrate a few common pitfalls and challenge the audience to provide their own solutions, with prizes on offer at the end of the conference.\r\n\r\nThis is a talk for everyone: beginners will be introduced to a problem that can be solved using primitives, experts will see opportunities to deploy advanced optimizations.\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/hamish-campbell-polyominoes-an-exploration-in-problem-solving-with-python", "state": 1, "category": "Kiwi PyCon 2013", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2013-09-12", "copyright_text": "", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXQW3MCOECU", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "A \"Polyomino\" is a geometric figure of adjacent squares.
