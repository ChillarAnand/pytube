    "description": "Step away from that database\n\nPresented by Andrew Godwin\n\nA look at the large array of database types now available: where each one\nexcels, why NoSQL isn't always best, and the best ways to integrate them into\nyour Django project.\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the last few years we've seen an explosion in the number of production-\nready databases available for web applications. From relational to document-\noriented, key-value and more, there's a staggering array of choice.\n\nThis talk covers the various basic types of database now available, and\nhighlights their weaknesses, their strengths, and the features you just can't\nget from traditional databases.\n\nThen, after a short rant about the term \"NoSQL\", learn how to best integrate\nthem into your Django projects, why being schemaless isn't as good as it looks\nat first, and how relational databases are keeping up with the times.\n\n",
