    "description": "So you want to be a core developer?\n\nPresented by Russell Keith-Magee\n\nThe most important part of Django is its community of contributors -- without\ncontributors, Django would never improve. However, as a newcomer to Django,\nthe prospect of contributing may be somewhat daunting. This presentation will\nshow you how to make the transition from user to contributor -- what to do,\nhow to do it, and some guidelines on how to do the job well.\n\nThe aim of this presentation is to explain how we do things in the core, and\nhow to work with us to get the job done. It will cover dealing with Trac and\nthe triage lifecycle, how to find tickets to triage, other non-obvious ways to\ncontribute, and cover some basic design philosophies.\n\n",
