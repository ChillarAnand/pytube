Our Top-level domains are shortened english\nwords. Our programming languages--Python in particular--try to emulate English\nwords and grammar.\n\nFirmly in place in this world for many years, my first attempt to translate a\npre-existing site came with a high sticker shock of nuanced difficulty. This\ntalk covers all the lessons I learned in taking a fully-fleshed web app with\nno translation (and a programmer with no translation experience) to being\ncompletely translated.\n\n# Talk Overview\n\n  1. Introduction to Translation\n\n    1. Overview of gettext\n\n    2. Brief history of a translation\n\n      1. Add gettext calls\n\n      2. `django-admin.py makemessages`\n\n      3. Ship po file to translation service\n\n      4. Receive file back\n\n      5. Compile\n\n      6. Fin\n\n    3. gettext vs gettext_lazy\n\n  2. Batteries Included\n\n    1. gettext Python calls\n\n    2. Middleware\n\n    3. template tags\n\n      1. trans vs. blocktrans\n\n    4. Anti-patterns of the battery included use.\n\n      1. Heavy whitespace in blocktrans\n\n      2. Monster-sized translations\n\n  3. The best laid plans of mice and men...\n\n    1. Problems that get in the way of A history of a translation.\n\n      1. Realize half the site is still untranslated\n\n      2. Edit out the translations you already had translated to avoid re-curring costs\n\n      3. Have the product adjust so two words change\n\n      4. Realize common text that's in the database\n\n      5. Fin?\n\n    2. Patterns and tools to help\n\n      1. `poxx.py` and the idea of a 'canonical' po file.\n\n      2. `dbgettext`\n\n      3. Wholly-translated template files (translate_include, trans_render)\n\n  4. Advanced Translation Technique\n\n    1. While undocumented, translation backend is pretty darn flexible and the source code is a treasure trove to make 'impossible' use cases not too bad.\n\n    2. Overview of how the translation service works behind the scenes\n\n      1. `_translation` thread local\n\n      2. Merged translations (root->app->default)\n\n      3. Sessions vs. Accept-Language\n\n      4. Middleware and Context processors\n\n    3. Example of advanced translation code: Multi-tenancy translation.\n\n      1. Translating some sites, not translating others\n\n      2. Translating Site A one way, Site B another\n\n      3. Using an English translation for duct-tape and profit.\n\n  5. Why Django's i18n sucks.\n\n    1. In the vein of the \"Django Sucks\" Key note. It doesn't really, but it could use some changes--from minor to major.\n\n    2. Why .po Files are archaic and limited.\n\n    3. What we can do to improve for 1.5 and beyond.\n", "state": 1, "category": "DjangoCon 2012", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2012-09-04", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2ZHZWfx60Y", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "Coming from a speaker who escaped a notion to \"why would we need to\ntranslate?\" this talk aims to show what actually goes into translating a\nwebsite or app using Django's Internationalization tools.
