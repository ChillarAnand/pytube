In\nthis talk, we'll present the survival skills required to manage your\nPostgreSQL database while trying to push the product out the door.\n\nWe'll cover:\n\n  * Installation.\n  * Basic tuning (it's easier than you think).\n  * Performance, including things you must not do.\n  * Backups and disaster recovery.\n  * Helpful tools, tips and tricks.\n\nDjango experience is helpful, but no PostgreSQL experience required.\n\n",
