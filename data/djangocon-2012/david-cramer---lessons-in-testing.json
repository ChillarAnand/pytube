With the complexities of large projects, and even small projects,\nwriting effective, automated tests can take many times longer than writing the\ncode and testing it by hand.\n\nThis talk will explore the various patterns of testing that DISQUS has\nimplemented, and iterated upon over the last two years. It will describe how\ntesting has been used to speed up the product lifecycle, improve stability\nthrough automation, and the culture shift required to get there. Most\nimportantly, it will cover the practices that have been put in place that have\nhelped ease the burden of writing tests.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "DjangoCon 2012", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2012-09-05", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_39Vbjx23Y", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "Learn from failures (and successes) around testing patterns and culture in a\ngrowing company, both in amount of code, and number of engineers.
