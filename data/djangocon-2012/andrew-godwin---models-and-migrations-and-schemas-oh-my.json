    "description": "Django has a long and varied history of dealing with changing schema\nrequirements - from the early projects like django-evolution and the two\naborted attempts to provide migrations in Django itself, through to projects\nlike South and now looking ahead to a more integrated solution with Django\nitself once more.\n\nThis talk will cover some of that history - helpful to get some kind of\ncontext when it comes to current developments - as well as exploring some of\nthe common problems a migration system (and its users) encounter, and how\nthose lessons and ideas are being used to help improve Django itself to better\nsupport schema migrations.\n\n",
