In this session I will give an overview of the Kivy development and deployment process.  I will also draw inspiration from my successes and failures in developing Python programs with Kivy to highlight Kivy's strengths, weaknesses and idiosyncracies.   Code examples will be kept to a minimum, with a focus on illustrating the capabilities of the Kivy library and explaining how its parts work together. \r\n\r\nI will also reserve some time to discuss the Pygame Subset for Android and how it can be used to deploy Pygame based games to Android devices.", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon AU 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-08-09", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KPcBOpC-rw", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": "http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/37-out.ogv", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-08-14T16:34:18.006", "id": 3113, "related_urls": [], "slug": "deploy-to-android-adventures-of-a-hobbyist-by-br", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Brendan Scott"]}
