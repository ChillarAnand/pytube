I don\u2019t have a pony. But we do have record linkage. \r\n\r\nRecord linkage (also known as data linkage or fuzzy record matching) is a naive Bayes algorithm which matches data about individuals across databases or within a single database, by constructing the probabilities that two records apply to the same individual or to different individuals.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will discuss the techniques of record linkage in Python, the usefulness and the limitations of linkage, and the effect that this technique is having on healthcare research in particular.\r\n\r\nHealthcare/epidemiology studies often require data from more than one source, and individuals frequently have multiple interactions with a data set without a unique identifier. The outcomes of these studies are only as good as the record linkage which underlies them, so the ways in which record linkage is done can have a direct impact on our ability to understand, prevent and treat serious medical conditions.", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon AU 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-08-09", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEcVIjyHfiQ", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": "http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/35-out.ogv", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-08-14T19:07:48.150", "id": 3115, "related_urls": [], "slug": "record-linkage-join-for-real-life-by-rhydwyn-mcg", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Rhydwyn Mcguire"]}
