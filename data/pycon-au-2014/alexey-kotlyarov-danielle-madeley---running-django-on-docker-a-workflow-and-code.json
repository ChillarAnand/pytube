Here at Infoxchange, we are extremely excited about how Docker allows a build-once, run-anywhere approach to moving applications from testing through to production. We are one of the first organisations to be using Docker in production on high-SLA applications.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will present:\r\n\r\n- a quick intro to Docker and how it solves our problems at Infoxchange;\r\n- our interface for hosting applications on Docker (\"pallet\");\r\n- how to build and develop a Python app on Docker;\r\n- Infoxchange's Django settings module for the pallet interface;\r\n- Forklift (https://github.com/infoxchange/docker-forklift), a tool we've developed for running and developing apps that use the pallet interface, in and out of a Docker container; and\r\n- Extending forklift for your services.\r\n\r\nIf time permits we will try and cover the additional bonus topics:\r\n\r\n- How to host your legacy mod_python application on Apache inside Docker with minimal changes; and\r\n- Using Forklift to do automated full-stack integration testing of apps by spinning up containers of other apps (which we do in a container that is testing the built app that is running in a container that is our CI server... inception is possible).\r\n\r\nThe talk will be presented by Danielle Madeley and Alexey Kotlyarov.", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon AU 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-08-09", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgL8r--p97s", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": "http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/19-out.ogv", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-08-14T19:10:28.665", "id": 3136, "related_urls": [], "slug": "running-django-on-docker-a-workflow-and-code-by", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Alexey Kotlyarov", "Danielle Madeley"]}
