Lists, dictionaries and tuples are our friends. However, sometimes you want more than what they can give.\r\n\r\nWhile subclassing is a great approach, often what you want has already been written. Most often, it\u2019ll be waiting for you within the standard library. This talk will be a tour of some of what awaits you. Don\u2019t be the next person to recreate an ordered dictionary.\r\n\r\nWithin the collections module, as well as other places within the standard library, you\u2019ll find lots of functionality. Using these data structures can lead to simpler, more robust code.\r\n\r\nAs well as explaining how to use some of the data structures that we encounter, we\u2019ll also be checking through open source code to see how they are used in the real world. This will give us insight into how other programmers are using them.
