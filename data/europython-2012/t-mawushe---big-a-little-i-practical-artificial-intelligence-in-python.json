When a program displays a lack of even the most basic awareness\nof context it is jarring. At the same time organisations are seeking to gain a\ncompetitive advantage through software that behaves adaptively based on the\ninformation at hand. Solving these problems is a challenge for today\u2019s\ndevelopers. There is general agreement among seasoned developers that having a\ngood understanding of basic computer science data structures and algorithms is\nessential. That said there is one sub-section of algorithms that is underused\nby most developers, the algorithms that fall under the general rubric of\nArtificial Intelligence. This talk aims to remedy that by providing a quick\nrefresher course on basic AI algorithms using Python. This talk is not about\nbuilding thinking machines, but rather about creating software that users\nwon\u2019t think is stupid. Basic AI techniques such as Constraint Propagation and\nIdentification Trees, can really help developers along the road to smarter\nsoftware.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "EuroPython 2012", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2012-07-05", "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvKO63BSc9c", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2012] T Mawushe - 4 JULY 2012 in \"Track Ravioli\"\n\n", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.232", "id": 1302, "related_urls": [], "slug": "big-a-little-i-practical-artificial-intelligence", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["T Mawushe"]}
