    "description": "Flask is a Python web framework that is both lightweight and powerful. With an active community, and a diverse and versatile choice of plugins, Flask allows you to scale from simple single-URL websites through to highly complex website architectures. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we will begin by setting up a simple Flask powered website and get it running on the Heroku PaaS. We will then demonstrate how to integrate Flask and SQLAlchemy (a powerful ORM) to allow database access and get this uploaded and working on Heroku as well.\r\n\r\nFinally we will discuss some more advanced concepts and review a number of the Flask plugins to get you started on the path to building great web-based projects.\r\n\n\n",
