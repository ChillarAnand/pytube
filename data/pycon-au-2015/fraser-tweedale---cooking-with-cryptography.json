    "description": "The ``cryptography`` library emerged in 2014 with the goal of\nbecoming Python's \"cryptographic standard library\".  It is designed\nto be easy to use but flexible, exposing a *recipes* layer for\ncommon use cases, and a *hazmat* layer that provides crypto\nprimitives but demands users know what they're doing in order to use\nthem properly.\n\nThis talk will explain the motivations and goals of the\n``cryptography`` library, take a tour of its features and discuss\nits implementation.  ``cryptography`` will be compared to some other\npopular and emerging crypto libraries.  Finally, we will examine\nsome real-world use of the library.\n\nAudience members should have a passing familiarity with cryptography\n(e.g. know the differences between hashing and encryption, or public\nkey and private key crypto) to get the most out of this talk.\n\n",
