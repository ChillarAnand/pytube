It is designed\nto be easy to use but flexible, exposing a *recipes* layer for\ncommon use cases, and a *hazmat* layer that provides crypto\nprimitives but demands users know what they're doing in order to use\nthem properly.\n\nThis talk will explain the motivations and goals of the\n``cryptography`` library, take a tour of its features and discuss\nits implementation.  ``cryptography`` will be compared to some other\npopular and emerging crypto libraries.  Finally, we will examine\nsome real-world use of the library.\n\nAudience members should have a passing familiarity with cryptography\n(e.g. know the differences between hashing and encryption, or public\nkey and private key crypto) to get the most out of this talk.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon AU 2015", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2015-08-17", "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c16jwvOmKxM", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2015-10-18T16:10:57.379", "id": 3989, "related_urls": [], "slug": "cooking-with-cryptography", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Fraser Tweedale"]}
