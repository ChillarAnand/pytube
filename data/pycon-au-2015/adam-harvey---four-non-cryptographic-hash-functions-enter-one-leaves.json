    "description": "When you say \u201chash function\u201d in a room full of Python developers, people tend to think of the classics you get in hashlib: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-OHGODPLEASESTOP, and the like \u2014 cryptographic hash functions intended for cryptographic uses.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s another world out there, though: non-cryptographic hashes. Sometimes you just need to figure out if you\u2019ve already seen a string or structure. Sometimes you need a basic checksum. Sometimes you need a hash that\u2019s just fast and can fit into a 32 bit integer.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll run through the state of the art in the world of non-cryptographic hashing \u2014 what your best options are, how they compare in terms of CPU and memory usage, and how they work. Who takes it? Whose mixing function reigns supreme?\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s find out.\r\n\r\n* I\u2019m saying \u201cfour\u201d, but realistically I\u2019m going to cover as many modern options as I can fit into the time available. Let\u2019s say \u201cfour plus two or minus one\u201d in reality.\n\n",
