Languages such as Python, and even HTML/CSS, are more difficult to introduce, partly because more skills are required before something \"useful\" can be created, and partly because the \"building blocks\" are usually not presented with the same visual immediacy as Scratch, and similar environments. This talk presents some of the difficulties found in transitioning from graphical environments to Python, and observations in using existing tools for learning Python with younger students.\r\n\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon AU 2015", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2015-08-04", "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlw6SXSb5eU", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2015-10-18T16:10:56.006", "id": 3980, "related_urls": [], "slug": "trials-tribulations-teaching-python-at-coderdoj", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Caleb Hattingh"]}
