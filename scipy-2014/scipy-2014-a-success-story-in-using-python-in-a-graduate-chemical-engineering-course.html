<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Historically, Matlab has been the primary math software tool used in our
courses on Chemical Engineering. Last year, I taught the first course in the
department using Python. In this talk I will present how I did that, and why
it was possible. The first step was demonstrating that Python + numpy +
scipy + matplotlib can solve all the problems we used to solve with Matlab.
This was documented in a project called PYCSE through a series of over one
hundred blog posts and organized in a web site ([1][]). Second, the
development of Python distributions such as Enthought Canopy made it
possible to students to easily install and use Python. I had to augment this
with some additional functionality with PYCSE ([2][]) which adds some
statistical analysis, differential equation solvers, numerical
differentiation functions and a publish function to convert Python scripts
to PDF files with captured output for grading. The only feature of Python
missing is a robust units package; several partial solutions exist, but none
solve all the needs of engineering calculations. Third, Emacs + org-mode
enabled me to write the course notes with integrated Python code and output.
These notes were provided to the students in PDF form, and annotated during
lecture using a tablet PC. Finally, the course was administered with box.com
and a custom python module to automate assignment collection and return
([3][]). An integrated grade widget in the PDF files that was created when
the students published their assignments was used to aggregate the grades
for the gradebook. I used an innovative homework schedule of one problem
every 2-4 days with rapid feedback to keep students using Python frequently.
We used timed quizzes and online exams to assess their learning. Overall,
the course was successful. Student evaluations of the course were as good as
courses that used other software packages. Based on my experiences, I will
continue to use Python and expand its role in engineering education.</p>
